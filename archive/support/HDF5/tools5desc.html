shorter development times than would be possible without the
infrastructure. Very careful design and
documentation allows said collaborator to enter the software at many

Chombo to investigate deep technical issues of adaptive mesh refinement
algorithms or to simply
adapt the example applications to solve different scientific problems.

<A NAME="slh5"> </a>
<P>
<DT><A HREF="http://space.mit.edu/cxc/software/slang/modules/slh5/">SLh5</A>
<DD>SLh5 is an open-source HDF5 module for <A HREF="http://www.s-lang.org">S-Lang
</A>.
The S-Lang interpreter provides a scripting environment well-suited for
scientific and engineering tasks, due to the powerful vectorized numerical
capabilities that are native to the language.
<P>
SLh5 provides a fast, high-level interface which makes it very easy to
create multidimensional S-Lang objects from HDF5 files, or vice versa.
The SLh5 interface is also unique in that it is <em>vectorized</em>
for S-Lang, allowing multiple HDF5 files to be opened or created, or
multiple datasets or attributes to be read, in a single call.
<P>
SLh5 may be imported at runtime into any suitable application which embeds
the S-Lang interpreter, such as the

<A NAME="swarm"> </a>
<P>
<DT><A HREF="http://www.swarm.org/index.php/Main_Page">Swarm</A>
<DD>Swarm is a simulator that provides fine-grained, composable
scheduling.  It is eventually intended to work in both distributed and
multithreaded shared-memory configurations.  HDF5 is the primary object 
serialization backend in Swarm.  Object storage in HDF5 is expected to be 
a natural substrate for parallel, high performance random read/write access 
to objects in Swarm models.
<p>
Swarm has another backend that reads and writes objects in Scheme, so
Swarm can be used to convert HDF5 files to and from Scheme.
