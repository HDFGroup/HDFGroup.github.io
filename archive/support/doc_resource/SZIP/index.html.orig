Szip compression software, 
providing lossless compression of scientific data, 
has been provided with HDF software products as of 
HDF5 Release 1.6.0 and
HDF4 Release 2.0.

Szip is an implementation of the extended-Rice lossless compression algorithm.  
The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has adopted the 
extended-Rice algorithm for international standards for 
space applications[<a href="References_szip.html#PerfAnalysis">1</a>,<a href="References_szip.html#CCSDS1">6</a>,<a href="References_szip.html#CCSDS2">7</a>].
Szip is reported to provide fast and effective compression, specifically for 
the EOS data generated by the NASA Earth Observatory System 
(EOS)[<a href="References_szip.html#PerfAnalysis">1</a>].
It was originally developed at University of New Mexico (UNM) and 
integrated with HDF4 by UNM researchers and developers.

<p>
As the graphs to the right illustrate, the primary gain with Szip compression 
is in speed of processing.  Szip also provides some advantage in 
compression ratio over other compression methods shown here.  
These results, including the data presented in the graphs below, 
are from tests conducted by Pen-Shu Yeh, et al. 
[<a href="References_szip.html#PerfAnalysis">1</a>], 
with the HDF4 Szip integration.

<h3>Szip and HDF5</h3>

<b>Using Szip compression in HDF5:</b>
Szip is a stand-alone library that is configured as an optional filter 
in HDF5. 
Depending on which Szip library is used (encoder enabled or decode-only), 
an HDF5 application can 
create, write, and read datasets compressed with Szip compression, 
or can only read datasets compressed with Szip.
<p>
Applications use Szip by setting Szip as an optional filter when a 
dataset is created. If the Szip encoder is enabled with the HDF5 library, 
data is automatically compressed and decompressed with Szip during I/O. 
If only the decoder is present, the HDF5 library cannot create and write 
Szip-compressed datasets, but it automatically decompresses 
Szip-compressed data when data is read.
<p>
See this <a href="H5_szip_example.html">sample HDF5 program</a>
for an illustration of the use of Szip compression with HDF5.
<p>
Details of the required and optional parameters are provided in the
<a href="/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5P.html#Property-SetSzip"><code>H5Pset_szip</code></a>
entry in the <cite>HDF5 Reference Manual</cite>.

<p>
<b>Software distribution:</b>
Starting with Release 1.6.0, HDF5 has been distributed with Szip enabled,
making it easier to use Szip compression.
The software is distributed as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Pre-compiled HDF5 binaries are provided with the Szip encoder enabled.
  <li>Szip source code will be distributed by The HDF Group.  
  <li>Users who cannot legally use Szip encoding should download and 
      install the decode-only Szip library.  
</ul>


<h3>Szip and HDF4</h3>


<b>Using Szip compression in HDF4:</b>
Szip is a stand-alone library that is configured as an optional filter in HDF4.
To use Szip with HDF4, the Szip library must be downloaded and  
the HDF4 library must be configured and compiled with Szip support and 
with the Szip library.
<p>
Applications use Szip by setting Szip as an optional filter when 
a dataset is created.  Once enabled, data is automatically compressed
and decompressed with Szip during I/O.
<p>
See this <a href="H4_szip_example.html">sample HDF4 program</a>
for an illustration of the use of Szip compression with HDF4.
<p>
Details of the required and optional parameters are provided in the
<code>SDsetcompress</code>, <code>SDgetcompress</code>, 
<code>SDsetchunk</code>, <code>SDgetchunkinfo</code>, 
and <code>HCget_config_info</code> 
entries in the <cite>HDF4 Reference Manual</cite>.
<p>
<!--
HDF4 provides substantial bug fixes and includes 
a few changes in the use of Szip; users should upgrade to HDF4 Release 2.1 
as soon as possible. 
Szip has been extensively tested in this release, but has not been user-tested. 
Users are encouraged to use Szip and report any problems to The HDF Group 
as soon as possible. For more details see the
<a href="SZIP_HDF4_2r1.pdf">release notes for Szip in HDF4 Release 2.1</a>.
-->

<p>
<b>Software distribution:</b>
HDF4 is distributed with Szip enabled,
making it easier to use Szip compression:
<ul>
  <li>Szip will be enabled and pre-configured in pre-compiled HDF4 binaries.
<!--
  <li>Szip source code and Szip binaries will be distributed by The HDF Group.
      (<a href="/ftp/lib-external/szip/">FTP</a>)
-->
  <li>Users who cannot legally use Szip encoding should download and 
    build the HDF4 library with the decode-only Szip library. 

</ul>



<h3>Licensing terms</h3>

The version of Szip distributed with HDF products is free for 
non-commercial use, which may occur in two sets of circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Non-commercial users may use the Szip software integrated with 
    HDF products to both encode (compress) and decode (uncompress) data.
    This applies to educational and research applications.
<li>Commercial users may use the software to decode any data.
    Further, they may use the software in internal activities that 
    do not involve or result in the development of 
    an Szip-based software product.
</ul>
<p>
Commercial licenses are available for commercial users who wish to
distribute an Szip-based software product or engage in commercial uses
that are not allowed above.
For further licensing information or 
to view a copy of the Szip copyright statement, see 
<a href="Commercial_szip.html">Commercial use terms and the 
copyright and license notice</a> pertaining to Szip in HDF products.
