<A NAME="1"></a><hr><H3>What is HDF?</H3>

   HDF stands for Hierarchical Data Format.  It is a library and 
   multi-object file format for the transfer of graphical and numerical 
   data between machines.  
<P>
   It is freely available.  The distribution consists of the 
   HDF library, the HDF command line utilities, and a test suite (source code 
   only). 
<P>
   Features of the HDF File Format:
<P>
<ul class="ul"> 
<li class="li3">      It is versatile. HDF supports several different data models.  Each
      data model defines a specific aggregate data type and provides an
      API for reading, writing, and organizing data and metadata of the
      corresponding type.  Data models supported include multidimensional
      arrays, raster images, and tables.
<P>
<li class="li3">      It is self-describing, allowing an application to interpret
      the structure and contents of a file without any outside information. 
<P> 
<li class="li3">      It is flexible.  With HDF, you can mix and match related objects
      together in one file and then access them as a group or as
      individual objects.  Users can also create their own grouping
      structures using an HDF feature called vgroups.
<P> 
<li class="li3">      It is extensible.  It can easily accommodate new data models, 
      regardless of whether they are added by the HDF development team or 
      by HDF users. 
<P>
<li class="li3">      It is portable.  HDF files can be shared across most common platforms,
      including many workstations and high performance computers.
      An HDF file created on one computer can be read on a different
      system without modification.

<hr />
<h3>Should new products be developed in HDF (HDF4) ?</h3>
<p>
No, we do not recommend storing new products in HDF4. You should use HDF5 instead.
We also want to encourage and help users move from HDF4 to HDF5. Please let us know
if you need help with this.
</p>

<p>
HDF4 still works well for many users, and we are pleased that it has served users
so well. However, there are good reasons to use or move to HDF5.
</p>

<p>
In general, HDF4 is based on technology from the 1980's and 1990's.  
Some specific reasons to use HDF5 instead of HDF4 are listed below:
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 is very flexible in determining how to build on unknown platforms.
In HDF4, code changes must be made to support new platforms or compilers (especially for Fortran).
</p>
</li>
<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 does not have a file size limitation.
In theory, HDF4 has a 2 GB limit on file sizes. In reality, the size of the files you can store in 
HDF4 is less than 2 GB, particularly if you have a lot of objects.
</p>
</li>

<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 has one flexible data model and supports a rich collection of datatypes. 
HDF4 has several rigid data models and supports a small number of datatypes.  
</p>
</li>

<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 provides an easy mechanism for applications to invoke data filters such as an 
application-specific compression method. This feature is not available in HDF4.


<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 is designed to support fast I/O on massively parallel systems, as well as for fast 
serial data acquisition. 
HDF4 does not support parallel I/O, and is much slower for serial data acquisition.
</p>
</li>

<li class="li3">
<p>
HDF5 is in active development, and HDF4 is in maintenance mode only.
</p>
</li>
<li class="li3">
<p>
Lastly, HDF5 is more powerful than HDF4, and HDF5 continues to become even more powerful
as new features are added.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="/products/hdf5_tools/h4toh5/h4vsh5.html">HDF vs. HDF5 table</a> which compares HDF4 and HDF5 features.
</p>


<A NAME="2"></a><hr><H3> What is in the HDF library? </H3>

   HDF currently supports several data structure types:
   Scientific Datasets (multi-dimensional arrays), vdatas (binary tables),
   "general" raster images, text entries (annotations), 8-bit 
   raster images, 24-bit raster images, and color palettes.
<P>
   HDF contains: the base library, the multi-file (SDS) library, the 
   jpeg library, and the gzip library.  HDF library functions can be called 
   from C or FORTRAN user application programs. 
<P>
   The base library contains a general purpose interface and application 
   level interfaces, one for each data structure type. Each application 
   level interface is specifically designed to read, write and manipulate 
   one type.  The general purpose interface contains functions, such as 
   file I/O, error handling, memory management and physical storage. 
<P>
   The multi-file (SDS) library integrates the netCDF model with HDF Scientific data 
   sets, and supports simultaneous access to multiple files and multiple 
   objects. This part is referred to as the mfhdf library in the rest 
   of this FAQ. 
<P>
   The jpeg and gzip libraries allow you to use jpeg and gzip compression
   for those application programming interfaces that support them.
<P>
<A NAME="3"></a><hr><H3> What are the HDF command line utilities? </H3>

   The HDF command line utilities are application programs that can be 
   executed by entering them at the command level, just like UNIX commands. 
<P>
   There are HDF utilities to:<P>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li3"> analyze and view HDF files ('hdp' being one of the more useful tools)
<li class="li3"> convert from one format to another
<li class="li3"> manipulate HDF files
</UL>
<p>
   They provide capabilities for doing things with HDF files for which you 
   would normally have to write your own program.
</p>
<P>
   The 'hdp' utility is one of the more useful HDF utilities.  Following is
   a description of its function:
<UL>
      It provides quick information about the contents and data objects 
      in an HDF file.  It can list the contents of hdf files at various 
      levels with different details.  It can also dump the data of one or 
      more objects in the file in binary or ASCII format.  
</UL>
<P>
   The other utilities are:
<P>
<ul class="ul">

<A NAME="4"></a><hr><H3> What is the latest official release of HDF, and what 
platforms does it support?</H3>
<p>
  See the <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/release4/obtain.html">download</a> page for the latest official release of HDF and the platforms supported. 
</p>

<hr>
<a name="4a"></a>
<h3>When will the next release of HDF4 be?</h3>

<p>In general, a maintenance release of HDF4 occurs once a year 
February. HDF5 releases occur every six months around May and November.
</p>
 
<A NAME="5"></a>
<hr>
<H3> What are the new features included in the current 
release?</H3>
   Details are listed in the <A HREF="/ftp/HDF/HDF_Current/src/unpacked/release_notes/RELEASE.txt">RELEASE.txt</A> file of the release.


<a name="6"></a><hr><H3> Is there a Java Interface?</H3>
   
   Yes, there is a Java Interface for HDF.  For information on this
   please refer to the <a href="/products/java/index.html">HDF Java Products</a> web page, 
  <!-- 
<A NAME="6a"><hr><H3> Is HDF Y2K compliant?</H3></A>
   Yes, it is Y2K compliant.  There are dates used in strings within
   the HDF library and in the HDF tests.  The strings in the HDF 
   library are for identification purposes only, and the strings in the 
   tests are for testing the use of global attributes in the netcdf interface.
   These strings just happen to have dates in them, but they could very well 
   have any value.
   <P>
   Please see the HDF Y2K Compliance statement under 
   <A HREF="/support.html">Support Issues</A>
   off of the HDF home page.
   <P>
-->

<A NAME="6b"></a>
<hr><H3> Are there limitations to HDF4 files?</H3>

Yes. Here are some of the limitations on HDF4 files: 
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li3">HDF4 files cannot be larger than 2 GB.
<li class="li3">There is a limit of 20000 objects in an HDF4 file.  Usually
    the limit is even less than that, and depends on the type of
    objects or features used.
<li class="li3">Minimal parallel I/O support.
<li class="li3">Supports only 1-D array of compound datatypes.
<li class="li3">Cannot easily delete or move objects in a file.
<li class="li3">Supports only 1 unlimited dimension (SD).
<li class="li3">Datasets with an unlimited dimension cannot be chunked or compressed. (SD)
</UL>

<hr />
<a name="namelen"></a>
  <h3>Is there a limit on the name of a dataset?</h3>

<p>
 No. HDF has always allowed any length to be specified for a name,
 when creating an SDS, Vdata, or Vgroup. However, prior to HDF 4.2r2, the
 behavior was undefined for names that were greater than 64
 characters, which caused problems for tools reading the data.
 Either characters were concatenated to the name or, in the
 case of the hdp tool, a crash occurred due to accessing
 undefined memory.
</p>

<p>
 As of HDF 4.2r2, released in 2007, this issue was fixed and
 a name with any length could be retrieved. The SDgetnamelen,
 Vgetnamelen<a href="#note">*</a>, and Vgetclassnamelen<a href="#note">*</a> APIs were introduced for
 retrieving the length of a name.
</p>

<a name="note"></a>
* Vgetnamelen and Vgetclassnamelen were added to the source
  code in HDF 4.2r2, but were inadvertently left out of the
  documentation until HDF 4.2.5, and are therefore listed

<A NAME="10"></a><hr><H3> How do I install HDF (4)? </H3>

<I>Optional:</I> &nbsp; 
Set environment variables to point to the correct compilers.
For example:
 <PRE>
   setenv CC "/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -xarch=v9"
   setenv F77 "/opt/SUNWspro/bin/f90 -xarch=v9"
</PRE>

Also, remember that HDF4 builds with Fortran by default. 
Particularly on 
systems that support both 32-bit and 64-bit, HDF may pick up the 
wrong compiler.  
<P>
<I>Solaris ONLY:</I> &nbsp;
Make sure that your PATH variable points to the
correct <CODE>ar</CODE> and <CODE>tr</CODE> tools:
 <PRE>
    tr:  /usr/ucb/tr
    ar:  /usr/ccs/bin/ar
</PRE>
Following are the commands to build HDF.
The JPEG and ZLIB libraries are required.  You must include them
when configuring.  The SZIP library is optional.
<PRE>
  ./configure --with-zlib=/path_to_ZLIB_install_directory
                   --with-jpeg=/path_to_JPEG_install_directory
                   [--with-szlib=/path_to_SZIP_install_directory]
                   --prefix=/path_to_HDF4_install_directory

  gmake >& gmake.out
  gmake check >& check.out
  gmake install
</PRE>
To disable fortran:
<PRE>
  ./configure --disable-fortran  ... 
</PRE>
If you encounter problems where configure can't find the JPEG or ZLIB library,
but you know that you have specified the location properly, then it
may have found more than one JPEG/ZLIB installation and is confused. 
<P>
<A NAME="11"></a><hr><H3> How do I compile application programs that call HDF 
functions? </H3>

   To use HDF routines in your C program, you must either have the line 
   <I>#include "hdf.h"</I> if you do not use the mfhdf library, 
   or <I>#include "mfhdf.h"</I> if you do, near the beginning of your code. 
<P>
   The HDF Group provides the h4cc and h4fc scripts for compiling applications.
   These tools come with the pre-compiled binaries and source code.

<A NAME="11win"></a><hr><H3>Compiling on Windows: Unresolved symbols _ntohl and _htonl</H3>
   On Windows platforms you must include the <B>ws2_32.lib</B> library under
   <I>Project->Settings</I> (see "Object/Library Modules") in MSVC++.  
   For Windows ME (at least) the name of this library is <B>wsock32.lib</B>.
<P>
   This library is not included on all Windows platforms.  On Windows 95
   it is optional, but you can obtain it free of charge from Microsoft at:

<A NAME="11hdr"></a><hr><H3>What header file are you supposed to use in your application?</H3>

The header file <I>hdf.h</I> must be included in every HDF application
written in C, except for programs that call routines in the SD interface.
The header file, <I>mfhdf.h</I>, must be included in all programs that
call the SD interface routines.  
<P>
Fortran programmers who use compilers
that allow file inclusion can include the files <I>hdf.inc</I> and 
<I>dffunc.inc</I>.  If a Fortran compiler that does not support file
inclusion is used, the HDF library definitions must be explicitly defined
in the Fortran program as they are included in the header files of the 
HDF library.

<A NAME="11unbuf"></a><hr><H3>How to use open (unbuffered I/O) instead of fopen?</H3>

To use <I>open</I> instead of <I/>fopen</I> in HDF4, you must:
<OL>
<LI>Download and uncompress the HDF source code.
<LI>Edit the <code>./hdf/src/hdfi.h</code> file.
<LI>Find the section of code for the platform you are on. 
    For example on Solaris, find this line:
<PRE>
      #define DF_MT             DFMT_SUN
</PRE>
    Then go down further until you find the section below.

<LI>Change the 2nd define in the following lines in that section, from:
<PRE>
   #ifdef  HAVE_FMPOOL
   #define FILELIB PAGEBUFIO  /* enable page buffering */
   #else
   #define FILELIB UNIXBUFIO
   #endif
</PRE>
to:
<PRE>
   #ifdef  HAVE_FMPOOL
   #define FILELIB PAGEBUFIO  /* enable page buffering */
   #else
   #define FILELIB UNIXUNBUFIO
   #endif
</PRE>
</OL>

This will make HDF use unbuffered I/O.  
<P>
There is an unfixable bug in <CODE>fopen</CODE> on Solaris such that the
maximum number of open files that are allowed is 256.  The bug is fixed
in <CODE>open</CODE>.

<A NAME="1164"></a><hr><H3>Tips to port HDF to a new 64-bit platform</H3>
<OL>
<LI> To get an idea of the kind of changes you might need to do, search 
     for "CRAY" or "AIX5L64" strings in the files in the hdf/src and 
     mfhdf/libsrc directories.
<P>
<LI> You will definitely need to modify these source  files:
<PRE>
         hdf/src/hdfi.h
         mfhdf/libsrc/array.c
                      cdf.c
                      putget.c
                      xdrposix.c

         mfhdf/libsrc/config/netcdf-?.h

</PRE>
<LI>In the file <I>xdrposix.c</I>, check the <I>xdr_ops</I> structure and 
    compare it with the <I>xdr_ops</I> structure in the system <I>xdr.h</I> 
    file. You will also need to go through the source of all <I>xdrposix_*</I>
    functions listed in this structure and make sure that types
   of the arguments are consistent with the types of the arguments
   of the corresponding functions in the system <I>xdr.h</I> file.
<P>
<LI>When compiling use the -DBIG_LONGS compilation flag. If your machine is 
    little-endian, you would also need to use the -DSWAP compilation flag.  
<P>
<LI>To configure, you must create an mh-*  configure file. For example, to
    create the AIX 64-bit port, the mh-aix file was copied to mh-aix64.
    Then run configure.
<P>
<LI>Known Problems:  We know that there is a bug in the code 
    (at least for OSF1 V5.1) with NetCDF record variable. If there are 
    more than one record variables in the pure NetCDF file, 
   ncdump reads data incorrectly. We never checked it on other 64-bit 
   platforms. 32-bit platforms seems to be OK (by NASA users). If file is 
   created from *.cdl file, then data is correct. That tells us that at 
   least HDF part of the HDF4 Library is OK.
</OL>

<A NAME="11compute"></a>
<hr><H3>Configure fails, "cannot compute sizeof (int*), 77"</H3>
The problem is that you have to add the path to the SZIP library to 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, since it is a shared library.
<P>
To see this, you can edit config.log, go to the end, and search 
backwards for "compute".  You will find the compute error.  Then go back 
further, before the example program, and you will see that it cannot open 
the shared SZIP library.
<P>
<a name="11share"> </a>
<hr><h3> How can you compile HDF with shared libraries?</h3>
<p>
Prior to HDF 4.2r4, shared libraries were not supported in HDF4.
With HDF 4.2r4, shared libraries for C were added.  To build
the C shared library, configure with these flags:
</p>
<pre>
   --enable-shared --disable-fortran
</pre>
<p>
This is required as Fortran shared libraries are not supported.
Shared libraries are disabled by default.

<hr>
<A NAME="convnetcdf"></a>
<H3>How would you convert a netCDF file to/from HDF?</H3>

      The netCDF library from Unidata contains utilities ncdump and ncgen 
      to convert between the netCDF binary format and a text format called 
      CDL.  The HDF4 library from the HDF Group also contains
      utilities ncdump and ncgen that do the same thing, but this time the
      underlying binary file format is HDF. It is a little tricky to install
      both, because by default the HDF commands will overwrite the netCDF
      commands or vice versa.  You may want to rename the HDF commands. 
      (In the paragraphs below, the HDF versions of these tools are referred  
      to as hdf_ncdump and hdf_ncgen.)
      <P>
      To do the "conversion" you would follow these steps:
<PRE>
          ncdump -l 80 foo.nc &gt; foo.cdl
          # Edit CDL file with a text editor to work around various
          # problems encountered by hdf_ncgen
          hdf_ncgen -b -o foo.hdf foo.cdl
</PRE>
      HDF uses netCDF 2.3.2 when building the HDF versions of these
      tools, which is a very old version of netCDF.
      The need to edit the CDL file arises because hdf_ncgen cannot read 
      everything that ncdump can write.
 <P>  
      The "-l 80" option above is intended
      to work around one of hdf_ncgen's limitations: a maximum line length of
      80 characters. When hdf_ncgen encounters a problem, it halts and prints
      out the relevant line number in the CDL file. The error message will not
      necessarily make much sense, but when you go to that line you will
      usually find that the problem is reasonably obvious and easily 
      corrected. 
<P>
      You may also have to do things like strip out attributes containing 
      zero-length
      strings, remove netCDF fill values (represented in CDL as an underscore)
      and replace NaNs with finite floating-point values. (NaNs are illegal in
      netCDF anyway, though some platforms allow them.)
<P>
      There is a Windows executable called ncdf2hdf from  Fortner Software 
      (defunct) that does the conversion.  It is no longer available, 
      but may be found
      by searching the web.   However, the HDF files that it generates
      have been reported to lack some of the structure that is found in 
      the ones produced by the route above.

<A NAME="15"></a>
<hr><H3> Can new versions of HDF read HDF files written using 
older versions of the HDF library?</H3>

    Our goal is to make HDF backward compatible in the sense that HDF files 
    can always be read by newer versions of HDF. We have succeeded in doing 
    this so far, and will continue to follow the principle as much as 
    possible.  In many instances, HDF is also forward compatible, at least
    in regards to the data.  Metadata, such as attributes, may not be 
    readable by previous releases, but the data should be.  Please see the
    notes following the table below for information on when the data is
    not forward compatible.
<P>
    The table below lists the backward and forward compatibility of HDF in
    regards to the data (not metadata).  The Vdata and Vgroup interfaces have 
    been merged into HDF since HDF3.2.  Before then, they were in a separate 
    library named Vset.

   NOTES:
     - The table above does not include the low-level compression
       interface, which was introduced in HDF 4.0.
  
     - The SD interface should always be able to read an HDF file
       that was created with the DFSD interface. 

     - With HDF 4.1r2, the SD dimension representation introduced in 4.0r1
       will ONLY be used by default.  To be read by earlier versions of
       the software, the SDsetdimval_comp must be called to store the old
       and new dimension representations in an HDF file.
 
     - Old HDF libraries will NOT always be able to read HDF data written 
       by newer version HDF libraries. For example, HDF3.1 can not read 
       16-bit integer SDS's because HDF 3.1 did not support this data type. 

     - In HDF 4.1r1, chunking and Vdata/Vgroup attributes were
       added.  Previous releases will not be able to read data which
       was created using these features.
</PRE>
<A NAME="16"></a><hr><H3> Can application programs which work with old versions of 
the HDF library always be compiled with new versions of HDF?</H3>

   As HDF evolves some functions have to be changed or removed. For example, 
   in HDF3.2 some functions' formal parameters which were passed by value in
   HDF3.1 have to be passed by reference in order to support new number types. 
   When this happens, old application programs need to be modified so that
   they can work with the new library.
<P>
   Our policy is as follows: Keep existing functions unchanged as much as 
   possible; create new functions when necessary to accommodate new
   features; if a new function covers the feature of an existing old 
   function, the old function should still be callable by old application 
   programs; should an old function be phased out, the users
   will be forewarned and encouraged to switch to the new function; 
   an old function will be removed from the library only if it is in 
   conflict with the implementation of new features. 

<A NAME="17"></a><hr><H3> How does the 'integration of netCDF with HDF' affect 
application programmers? </H3>

   The mfhdf library was designed to be completely transparent 
   to the programmer.  HDF supports a "multi-file" SDS interface and
   the complete netCDF interface as defined by Unidata netCDF Release 2.3.2. 
   (<strong>Please note that HDF4 cannot read
     <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/netcdf/File-Format-Specification.html">NetCDF 64-bit</a>
    files.</strong>)

<p>
   Using either interface, you are able to read XDR-based netCDF files, 
   HDF-based netCDF files and pre-HDF4.x HDF files. The library determines
   what type of file is being accessed and handles it appropriately. Any of 
   the above types of files may be modified. However, the library will only 
   create new files based on HDF (you can't create new XDR-based netCDF files). 
<P>
   Summary of HDF and XDR file interoperability for the HDF and netCDF 
   application interfaces:

<A NAME="18"></a><hr><H3> Does HDF support data compression?</H3>

   HDF 4.0 (and later releases) supports a low-level compression interface, 
   which allows any data-object to be compressed using a variety of 
   algorithms.  
<P>
   Currently only three compression algorithms are supported: 
   Run-Length Encoding (RLE), adaptive Huffman, and an LZ-77 dictionary coder 
   (the gzip 'deflation' algorithm).  Plans for future algorithms include an 
   Lempel/Ziv-78 dictionary coding, an arithmetic coder and a faster Huffman 
   algorithm.
<P>
   HDF 4.0 (and later releases) supports n-bit compression for SDSs.
<P>
   HDF 4.0 (and later releases) supports RLE (Run Length Encoding), IMCOMP, and 
   JPEG compression for raster images.
<P>
   New with HDF 4.1 is support for "chunking" and "chunking with 
   compression".  Data chunking allows an n-dimensional SDS or GR image to be 
   stored as a series of n-dimensional chunks.  See the HDF User's Guide 
   for more information.
<P>
   With HDF4.2r0, HDF supports SZIP compression.  For further 
   information regarding it, see
   <CODE>
     <A HREF="/doc_resource/SZIP/">SZIP Compression in HDF Products</A></CODE>.  
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> &nbsp;  Compression and chunking are limited to <I>fixed</I>
sized datasets.  You cannot compress or chunk a dataset that has 
unlimited dimensions.

<A NAME="19"></a><hr><H3> Is there a mailing list for HDF discussions and 
questions?</H3>
<p>
   If you want to broadcast HDF technical questions to other HDF users in
   order to solicit their assistance, you can subscribe to the HDF-Forum
   mailing list.  See the 
   <a href="/services/community_support.html">Community Support</a> 
   page for information on subscribing to the HDF-Forum and accessing
   prior postings to this mailing list.

<A NAME="20"></a><hr><H3> How do I contribute my software to the HDF user 
community?</H3>

   There are two ways that you can do this:
<P>
<ul class="ul">
   <li class="li3"> You can either give us the software and we will place it on the the HDF Group 
     ftp server in the directory:
     <PRE>
      <A HREF="/ftp/HDF/contrib/">https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF/contrib/</A>
 </PRE>
   <li class="li3"> You can tell us where the software is located and we will add a pointer
     to it from our HDF home page, in the section <A HREF="/products/hdf4_tools/tools.html">What Software uses HDF?</A>.
<P>
   If you have developed or ported something you think would be helpful to 
   other users, please contact:
<PRE>
   help [at] hdfgroup [dot] org
</PRE>
Indicate that you would
   like to contribute your software to the HDF user community.  
<P>
   If you wish to have it placed on the HDF Group ftp server, then for other 
   users' convenience, your contribution package should include 
   the software itself, a Makefile if possible, a man-page, test programs
   and input data files for testing. A README file is required. It should 
   describe briefly the purpose, function and limitation of the software,
   on which platforms and operating systems it runs, how to compile, 
   install, and test it, and who and where to contact for comments, 
   suggestions, or bug reports. 
</UL>
<A NAME="21"></a><hr><H3> How do I make a bug report?</H3>

<p>
   All bug reports, comments, suggestions and questions should go to:
   <ul class="ul">
   <img src="/images/helpdesk.jpg">
   </ul>
</p>

<p>
   Attached below is a bug report template.  It is not required but
   gives an idea of the kind of information we need in order to resolve
   a problem.
</p>

<p>
