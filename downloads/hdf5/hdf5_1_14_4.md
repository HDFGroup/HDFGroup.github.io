## Doxygen Generated Reference Manual         

The new HDF5 documentation based on [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is available [here]({{site.url_docs}}/releases/hdf5/latest-docs.html)

This documentation is WORK-IN-PROGRESS. 

Since this portion of the HDF5 documentation is now part of the source code, it gets the same treatment as code. In other words, issues, inaccuracies, corrections should be reported as issues in [GitHub](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues), and pull requests will be reviewed and accepted as any other code changes.
