### Files

Applications that were created with earlier HDF5 releases may not compile with 1.12 by default.

The **[API Compatibility Macros in HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/API+Compatibility+Macros)** allow users to work around this issue. Users can specify a compatibility macro mapping for the version of HDF5 that an application was built with. For example, a 1.10 application can be built with 1.12 using either an application or library mapping as follows:

*   To compile an application built with a version of HDF5 that includes deprecated symbols (the default), make sure to pass `-DH5_USE_110_API` to the compiler. For example (C), you can specify `h5cc -DH5_USE_110_API` (autotools) and `cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DH5_USE_110_API"` (CMake).`   `

*   To build an HDF5 library with the 1.10 APIs you must set `DEFAULT_API_VERSION` to `v110` when configuring. For example, with autotools specify `--with-default-api-version=v110` and with CMake set `-DDEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v110` in the `HDF5options.cmake` file when using the CMake source release (`CMake-hdf5-1.12.2*`).

**_However, users will not be able to take advantage of some of the new features in 1.12 if using these compatibility mappings._**

See the **[Migrating from HDF5 1.10 to HDF5 1.12](https://confluence.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Migrating+from+HDF5+1.10+to+HDF5+1.12)** page and **[video](https://www.hdfgroup.org/2020/03/moving-applications-from-1-10-to-hdf5-1-12-video-materials/)** for more information.

### Doxygen Generated Reference Manual

The new HDF5 C-API documentation based on [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is available at

 [https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1\_12/](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1_12/)

Included are all core library functions documented in the current [documentation](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Core+Library) with the exception of H5P\[g,s\]et\_fapl\_\[[hdfs](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1_12/group___f_a_p_l.html#gae59e7d8e0e8823e6dd6034b66418ed00),[ros3](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/v1_12/group___f_a_p_l.html#title18)\].

Note that the Fortran-API is NOT included in this release, and will be included in a future release.  Online versions can be found at these URLs:

This documentation is WORK-IN-PROGRESS. That’s why all existing documentation will remain accessible for the foreseeable future.

Since this portion of the HDF5 documentation is now part of the source code, it gets the same treatment as code. In other words, issues, inaccuracies, corrections should be reported as issues in GitHub ([**https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues**](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/issues)), and pull requests will be reviewed and accepted as any other code changes.

### Tested Platforms and Configuration Features

NOTE:  HDF5-1.12 _requires_ MPI 3.

See the Supported Platforms section in the [Release Notes](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.12/hdf5-1.12.2/src/hdf5-1.12.2-RELEASE.txt) for details.

### Known Problems

A bug in the cray-mpich compiler had caused an HDF5 serial test to fail for the function H5Pset\_data\_transform. The bug description can be found here:  
[https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/spock\_quick\_start\_guide.html#olcfdev-118-parallel-hdf5-failures-when-running-on-gpfs](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/systems/spock_quick_start_guide.html#olcfdev-118-parallel-hdf5-failures-when-running-on-gpfs)  
The issue has been reported to OLCF and the workaround has been applied.
