# Contribute 

This repo provides the framework for the introductory pages (i.e. content for the top level pages) of The HDF Group's documentation for the above projects. These pages are build using Jeckyl and served via Github Pages. Feel free to contribute PRs and issues here, however if your contribution is specifically related to the documentation of those projects, those contributions belong in the repo for that project. Is it confusing? Yes. Please edit this page if you have a better way to explain this.
