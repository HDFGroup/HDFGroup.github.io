# Registered VOL Connectors

Members of the HDF5 users community can register VOL connectors for use with HDF5. To register a VOL connector please contact [The HDF Helpdesk](https://help.hdfgroup.org) with the following information: 

* Contact information for the developer requesting a new identifier
* Short description of the new connector
* Links to any relevant information including licensing information 

Here is the current policy regarding VOL connector identifier assignment: Valid VOL connector identifiers can have values from 0 through 255 for connectors defined by the HDF5 library. Values 256 through 511 are available for testing new VOL connectors.  Subsequent values should be obtained by contacting the [The HDF Help Desk](https://help.hdfgroup.org).

Please contact the maintainer of a VOL connector for help implementing the plugin.

## List of VOL Connectors Registered with The HDF Group

| Connector | Connector Identifier | Search Name\* | Short Description | URL | Contacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Asynchronous I/O | 512 | async | Provides support for asynchronous operations to HDF5 | [https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-async](https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-async) | Suren Byna (sbyna at lbl dot gov) |
| Cache | 513 | cache | Provides support for multi-level, multi-location data caching to dataset I/O operations | [https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-cache](https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-cache) | Suren Byna (sbyna at lbl dot gov) |
| Log-based | 514 | LOG | The log-based VOL plugin stores HDF5 datasets in a log-based storage layout.<br>In this layout, data of multiple write requests made by an MPI process are appended one after another in the file. Such I/O strategy can avoid the expensive inter-process communication and I/O serialization due to file lock contentions when storing data in the canonical order. Through the log-based VOL, existing HDF5 programs can achieve a better parallel write performance with minimal changes to their codes. | [https://github.com/DataLib-ECP/vol-log-based/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/DataLib-ECP/vol-log-based/blob/master/README.md) | Kai Yuan Hou <br> (khl7265 at ece dot northwestern dot edu) |

| pass-through| 517 | pass_through_ext | Provides a simple example of a pass-through VOL connector | [https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-external-passthrough](https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-external-passthrough) | Suren Byna (sbyna at lbl dot gov) |
| dset-split | 518 | dset-split | Creates separate sub files for each dataset created and mounts these sub-files as external links in the main file. It enables versioning of HDF5 files at a dataset boundary. | [https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-dset-split](https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-dset-split) | Annmary Justine (annmary dot roy at hpe dot com) |
| PDC-VOL | 519 | PDC-VOL | It is a terminal VOL that reads and writes HDF5 objects to the PDC system | [https://github.com/hpc-io/pdc](https://github.com/hpc-io/pdc) [https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-pdc](https://github.com/hpc-io/vol-pdc) | Houjun Tang (htang4 at lbl dot gov) |

| LowFive | 521 | LowFive | A new data transport layer based on the HDF5 data model, for in situ workflows. Executables using LowFive can communicate in situ (using in-memory data and MPI message passing), reading and writing traditional HDF5 files to physical storage, and combining the two modes. | [https://github.com/diatomic/LowFive](https://github.com/diatomic/LowFive) | Tom Peterka (tpeterka at mcs dot anl dot gov) <br> Dmitriy Morozov (dmorozov at lbl dot gov) |
