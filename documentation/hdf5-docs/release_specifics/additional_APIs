This page describes various new functions, a new struct, and new macros that are either unrelated to new features described elsewhere or have aspects that are unrelated to the feature where they are otherwise described. The page includes the following sections:

Versioned Functions and Struct with Associated Macros
Property List Encoding and Decoding Functions
External File Prefix Functions
Versioned Functions and Struct with Associated Macros
Two functions in the HDF5 C interface, and a struct associated with one of those functions, have been versioned in this release. At the same time, interface compatibility macros were created for programmatic management of these functions. See API Compatibility Macros in HDF5 for a detailed discussion of versioned functions and structs and the related macros.

These functions, struct, and macros are documented in the HDF5 Reference Manual:

H5F_GET_INFO	Macro for programmatic control of versioned functions
H5F_GET_INFO1	Original function
H5F_GET_INFO2	New version introduced at Release 1.10.0
 
H5R_DEREFERENCE	Macro for programmatic control of versioned functions
H5R_DEREFERENCE1   	Original function
H5R_DEREFERENCE2	New version introduced at Release 1.10.0
Property List Encoding and Decoding Functions
Functions have been added in the HDF5 C interface to encode and decode property lists.

These functions are documented in the HDF5 Reference Manual:

H5P_ENCODE
H5P_DECODE
External File Prefix Functions
Datasets that store raw data in external files can be created in HDF5. Functions have been added in the HDF5 C interface to enable such external files to be located via a relative path from the directory where the HDF5 file containing such a dataset is located:

These functions are documented in the HDF5 Reference Manual:

H5P_SET_EFILE_PREFIX
H5P_GET_EFILE_PREFIX
