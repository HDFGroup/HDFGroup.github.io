## Installation Instructions
Instructions for installing HDF5 can be found in the INSTALL_parallel file in the release_docs/ directory of the source code.

## Tutorials and Presentations
There are several HDF5 tutorials and presentations that will help in learning Parallel HDF5:

* Learning the Basics(https://portal.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_learn_basics.html)

: New users to HDF5 should work through this tutorial first. It does not cover parallel programming but contains basic information needed in order to use Parallel HDF5. For example, subsetting is not a parallel feature but it is commonly used in Parallel HDF5 and important to understand.

* [Introduction to Parallel HDF5](https://hdfgroup.github.io/hdf5/develop/_intro_par_h_d_f5.html)

: This tutorial is for users who are familiar with HDF5. It provides information on creating and writing to files with Parallel HDF5.

* Presentations:

: [Parallel HDF5 Short Course](HDF5-PARALLEL_ShortCourse.pdf)
: [Parallel HDF5 Performance Tuning](Parallel-HDF5-Performance-Tuning.pdf)
: [ECP Tutorial](20200206_ECPTutorial-final.pdf)

Users may also be interested in the [Introduction to Scientific I/O (PDF)](2016_NERSC_Introduction_to_Scientific_IO.pdf) tutorial provided by NERSC. It contains information on scientific I/O and parallel programming (which includes HDF5).
