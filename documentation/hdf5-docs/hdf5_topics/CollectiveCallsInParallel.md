# Collective Calling Requirements in Parallel HDF5 Applications

## Introduction
This document addresses two topics of concern in a parallel computing environment:
* HDF5 functions that must be called collectively and when
* Properties that must be used in a coordinated manner
The term Macro in the “Additional notes” column indicates that the first item in the “Function” column of the same row is a macro that is selectively mapped to one of the two immediately-following functions. For example, H5Acreate is a macro that can be mapped to either H5Acreate1 or H5Acreate2. This mapping is configurable and is explained in [API Compatibility Macros in HDF5](/documentation/hdf5/latest/api-compat-macros.html). The macro structure was introduced at HDF5 Release 1.8.0.

## Always collective
The following functions must always be called collectively.

| API |   Function  | All processes:<br>same datatype<br>& dataspace | All processes:<br>same access<br>properties | All processes:<br>same creation<br>properties | Available<br>in releases since | Additional notes |

## Collective, unless target object will not be modified

The following functions must normally be called collectively. If, however, the target object will not be modified, they may be called independently.
